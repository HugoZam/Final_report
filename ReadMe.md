### Sprint 4

1. Each team member should comment on their own accomplishments (Taken word for word from the sprint reports) and describe what they did and explain any decisions referencing any lectures or material from the text book or web.

Accomplishments sprint 4: "As Lead developer again the main goal after the purge of the cloudinary api was getting back functionality of things like searching for multiple pictures with tags which was done by splitting input from the tagline on a space, inserting them into the search array and then locating the picture among all the pictures tagged located on mongo DB. It was also to add more sleek functionality like making it so the 3 radio buttons only showed once “Get Started” was selected."

During this sprint being told we could no longer use the Cloudinary API, despite explaining our use of it
throughout the semester, we wanted to prove we could function without it. It was less work than anticipated,
the majority of the work was migrating our use of pulling meta data from mongo DB instead of the cloudinary storage in order to get the sear for tag function to work. It required extensive research on how we could replace Cloudinary in which I spent majority of lab time with my team mates discussing it. The other goal was to have a deployable system this time around which we had gotten a build script that was up and running mostly due to Jinwen who really took the time to understand how the scripts worked and brought that information back to the group, we managed to hit our goals this sprint.
